Retail Price Optimizer: A Demand Modeling & Predictive Pricing Engine
üéØ Project Aim: Maximizing Revenue with Data-Driven Pricing
The goal of this project was to develop a statistical model to predict product demand and subsequently use this prediction to guide pricing strategy that maximizes total revenue (or profit) across various retail categories.

This solution moves beyond static pricing by incorporating critical market factors, offering an actionable, data-driven strategy for dynamic pricing.

üìà Key Findings & Business Impact (Revised)
The predictive model serves as a powerful pricing guide by enabling a deeper understanding of market drivers and forecasting potential sales.

Multivariate Demand Forecasting: Created a multivariate regression model to accurately predict changes in unit sales (qty) based on a complex interplay of variables, including the product's unit_price, competitor prices (comp_1, comp_2, comp_3), and customer ratings.

Quantified Price Elasticity: Accurately measured how sensitive customer demand is to changes in unit_price for each product category. This provides critical context for setting target prices.

Data-Driven Pricing Guidance: The model's predictive output can be used by pricing analysts to simulate revenue at various price points, providing an informed recommendation for a high-performing price.

Competitor Influence: Provided a clear understanding of the impact of competitor pricing and customer ratings on unit sales.
